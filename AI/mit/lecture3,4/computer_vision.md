# Lecture 3 & 4

## Lecture 3: Deep Computer Vision

This is the ability to know what is where by looking
VIsion is not only about knowing what is where, but being able to understand what is happening in a visual paradigm.
This helps discover from images what is present in the world, where things are and what actions are taking place to predict and anticipate world events.

__The rise and impact of computer vision:__
    - Robotics
    - Accessibility applications
    - Mobile computing
    - Biology and medicine
    - Autonomous driving

### What computers see

To a computer images are just numbers represented as an array.
For a black and white image each pixel is repped by one number, if its a colored image each pixel is repped by three numbers( for rgb)
